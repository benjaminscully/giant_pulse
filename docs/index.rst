giant_pulse Documentation
-------------------------

Welcome to the documentation for the (bare bones) giant_pulse package! This package is designed to be used for 
finding giant pulses from pulsars in radio astronomy data files. Right now there's just one function for
combining multiple data files into one, but more functionality will be added in the future!
